### __System requirements__
To run the experiments in the paper, we used a 64-core (Intel Xeon Processor Gold 6226R, 2.90 GHz) machine
with 192 GB of RAM and Ubuntu 20.04. Out of 64 cores, We utilized 40 cores with 4 GB of RAM assigned for each core.

The system requirements depend on the desired experimental throughput.
For example, if you want to run 10 fuzzing sessions in parallel,
we recommend using a machine with at least 16 cores and 64 GB of RAM.

You can set the number of iterations to be run in parallel and the amount of RAM to assign to each fuzzing session
by modifying the `MAX_INSTANCE_NUM` and `MEM_PER_INSTANCE` variables in `scripts/common.py`.
The default values are 40 and 4, respectively.

Additionally, we assume that the following environment settings are met.
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Docker
- python 3.8+
- pip3
- available disk space of at least 25 GB

For the Python dependencies required to run the experiment scripts, run
```
yes | pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
